//in this program to reverse the order of the numbers in the array, you need to swap the elements symmetrically. means you swap the first element with the last element, the second element with the second-to-last element, and so on until you reach the middle of the array.
class Exercise5 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] val = {0, 1, 2, 3}; 
    int temp;

    System.out.println("Original Array: " 
        + val[0] + " " + val[1] + " " + val[2] + " " + val[3]);

    // reverse the order of the numbers in the array
    int n = val.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
      temp = val[i];
      val[i] = val[n - 1 - i];
      val[n - 1 - i] = temp;
    }// In each line the element at index i is swapped with the element at index n - 1 - i. This is done using the "temp" variable to hold the value of val[i] during the swap.
    System.out.println("Reversed Array: " 
        + val[0] + " " + val[1] + " " + val[2] + " " + val[3]);
  }
}//This method ensures the array is reversed correctly without any indexing errors or out-of-bound issues.
